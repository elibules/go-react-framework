# Go/React Microframework

This is a very simple microframework that delivers a single page application (in this case a React application).
Once the SPA is delivered to the client, the server will essentially act as a RESTful API, delivering requested content to the SPA.
Recently updated with examples in the struct, model, and controller files as to how one could build out the server.
