# Go/React Microframework

This is a very simple microframework that delivers a single page application (in this case a React application).
Once the SPA is delivered to the client, the server will essentially act as a RESTful API, delivering requested content to the SPA. 
I am currently using this same model to build out an ecommerce website for practice.
